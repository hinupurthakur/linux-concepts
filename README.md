Linux/ Unix Basic Concepts that I keep forgetting for no goddamn reason

1. Inode: Uniquely existing number for all the files in linux/unix filesystem.

![Screenshot from 2022-02-04 11-33-33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39610703/152480487-a6b2099c-81e0-488e-a8be-41402cc3f2ad.png)

The first number on the left indicates the inode number. `-i` flag is used to get the inode number
Note: The Inode doesn't contain file content, instead it has a pointer to that data.
